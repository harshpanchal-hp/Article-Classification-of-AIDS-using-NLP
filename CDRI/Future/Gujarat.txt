JAIPUR: Rajesh (name changed) had gone to donate blood to fulfil a social obligation at a camp organised here but he was completely shattered when the blood he donated was found to be HIV positive.His incident has brought to the fore the grim reality of the high prevalence of HIV positive people in the state who are not aware of their status.The recently released data of people, who donated blood in the last one financial year in the entire state, shows that among the donors as many as 819 were HIV positive.These people are not aware of the fact that they are carriers of the virus. All donated bloods are subjected to laboratory tests and if found HIV positive, are completely destroyed. Statistics show that there are 83 registered blood banks in the state, which collect blood through camps and also through replacement. In the last financial year, around 555 people went to the camps orgainsed by social organizations, hospitals and blood banks and donated blood voluntarily.Of the 4,57,304 people who donated blood from April 2010 to March 2011, 819 donors were found positive for HIV implying that one out of 558 people, who donated blood was carrying the AIDS virus.According to the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society, transfusion of HIV-infected blood is also a major reason for transmission of the virus. The society stated that one should take blood only from a licenced blood bank where it is tested for HIV.Jaipur, which has highest number of blood banks in the state, found 326 such cases registered in the last financial year. In Jodhpur, such cases were recorded at 90, Ajmer 47, Alwar 44, Bhilwara 27, Udaipur 40 and in Bikaner 25 such cases were found.In 2008, around 3,90,899 people had donated blood out of which 764 were HIV positive, and in 2009 the figure increased to 808, in the same year 3,94,917 people had donated blood.The state government is now taking the issue seriously and kick-started awareness campaigns on HIV/AIDS where folk artistes were roped in to interact with people in their local dialects on the requisite precautions to be taken for the disease.
