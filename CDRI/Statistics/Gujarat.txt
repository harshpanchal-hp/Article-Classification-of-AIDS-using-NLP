JAIPUR: Rajasthan is highly vulnerable state in terms of spread of AIDS. Despite this, only 15% of the pregnant women received HIV test in 2010-11 to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to child. The rest did not undergo the test due to social reasons.A survey conducted by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) shows that around 20 lakh women become pregnant in the state but only 15% of them receive HIV test.Around 3.02 lakh pregnant women took HIV test in the state out of which 362 women were tested positive, the survey shows.The state government in cooperation with the RSACS has provided various facilities under prevention of parent to child transmission (PPTCT), including free HIV test for pregnant women, counseling on antenatal care and sexually transmitted disease, providing nevirapine prophylaxis to mother and child for reducing HIV transmission from mother to child.Information, education and communication (IEC) joint director Pradeep Chaudhary, said, "We cannot force pregnant women for HIV test as it is against human rights. But we try to persuade them to go for the test as it beneficial for their children. If pregnant women tested are positive, we try to reduce the chance of transmission of HIV to her child by up to 4% by giving nevirapine prophylaxis. A dose of navirapine is given to the mother at a time of delivery to prevent HIV transmission to the child."The state government aims that all pregnant women should undergo the test. Chaudhary said, "There are some social reasons which desist pregnant women from undergoing the test."The state government has taken new initiatives which include opening of community-based HIV screening of pregnant women by Auxiliary Nursing and Midwifery (ANM) at sub-centre level of A and B category districts like Ajmer, Alwar, Barmer, Ganganagar, Jaipur, Tonk and Udaipur. Also, the state government has opened 11 ICTCs which provide HIV DNA PCR test for early diagnosis of HIV infection in a child.But the positive sign is that pregnant women going for HIV test are increasing every year. In 2005-06 the figure was 2,771, in 2006-07 it increased to 19,037, in 2007-08 it was 89,150, in 2008-09 it was 1,40,429 and it was 2,52,591 in 2009-10.
